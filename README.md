# Sierpinski Triangle Program

This program creates an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file containing the
commands to draw a Sierpinski fractal triangle. You can view the SVG file in a
web browser.

The settings for the programs, such as the colours of the triangles and the
path of the SVG file, are in the file **params.py**.


## How to run the program
